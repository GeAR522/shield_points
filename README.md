Shield Points

This will be a practise project to more fully learn the ins and outs of what is used in the PinPoint Stack.

This will be a slowly developed project, therefore features will added/changed as I learn.

Final goal - submitting the github PR link will detect who the creator is, check certain aspects and assign as many points as necessary to the creator.
Then update the leaderboard.
Furthermore, I want to add the ability to check monthly totals.

Currently, creating the basics of the site, adding in the points DB, making sure the CRUD system is fully functional.

next step. Learn to add up the sub of the checkboxes and get each _questions_ partial to calc and show the subtotal, then have the questions total get saved to the DB.
